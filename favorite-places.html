    <h3>Reuben's Favorite Places</h3>

    <p>Having done a lot of traveling, I've found some top favorites of mine. </p>

    <p><em>First, the <strong>Pacific Northwest</em></strong> as a whole is one of the most amazing places, so I'd put that at #1. <em>Costa Rica</em> is a close second in the #2 spot. Last, even though it's been a while, <strong>New Zealand</strong> would have to be #3.</p>

    <p> Let's take a look at some photos of these amazing places:
